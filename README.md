# Go Design Patterns

1. **Factory pattern:** This pattern is used to create objects in a super class, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
2. **Singleton pattern:** This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it.
3. **Builder pattern:** This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

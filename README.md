# Go Design Patterns

1. **Factory pattern:** This pattern is used to create objects in a super class, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
2. **Singleton pattern:** This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it.
3. **Builder pattern:** This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
4. **Prototype pattern:** This pattern creates new objects by copying existing objects, rather than creating new objects from scratch.
5. **Adapter pattern:** This pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping their own interface around that of an already existing class.
6. **Decorator pattern:** This pattern allows additional behavior to be added to an existing object dynamically, by wrapping the object in a decorator class.
7. **Observer pattern:** This pattern allows objects to observe events happening in other objects, and respond accordingly.
8. **Template pattern:** This pattern defines the steps of an algorithm, but allows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps.

# Go Design Patterns

1. **Factory pattern:** This pattern is used to create objects in a super class, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

2. **Singleton pattern:** This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it.

3. **Builder pattern:** This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

4. **Prototype pattern:** This pattern creates new objects by copying existing objects, rather than creating new objects from scratch.

5. **Adapter pattern:** This pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping their own interface around that of an already existing class.

6. **Decorator pattern:** This pattern allows additional behavior to be added to an existing object dynamically, by wrapping the object in a decorator class.

7. **Observer pattern:** This pattern allows objects to observe events happening in other objects, and respond accordingly.

8. **Template pattern:** This pattern defines the steps of an algorithm, but allows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps.

9. **Generator Pattern:** The generator pattern is a design pattern in which a generator function is used to generate a sequence of values, one at a time, on demand.

10. **Command pattern:** This pattern involves encapsulating a request as an object, which enables you to parametrize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

11. **Facade pattern:** This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system. It hides the complexity of the system and provides a higher-level interface to the client.

12. **Flyweight pattern:** This pattern reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing them.

13. **Iterator pattern:** This pattern enables you to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
